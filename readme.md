## Introduction
Stock price prediction is a crucial task in the financial market, enabling investors to make informed decisions. This project utilizes an LSTM model to analyze historical stock price data and predict future prices. LSTMs are advantageous due to their ability to capture long-term dependencies in time-series data.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training the model consists of historical stock price data. The data includes features such as:
- Date
- Open price
- High price
- Low price
- Close price
- Volume

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- tensorflow
- keras

You can install the required libraries using the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow keras
```

## Usage
1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Stock-Price-Prediction-using-LSTM.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Stock-Price-Prediction-using-LSTM
```
3. Open the Jupyter notebook `Stock_Price_Prediction.ipynb` to see the data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation steps.

## Model Architecture
The LSTM model used in this project has the following architecture:
- Input layer
- LSTM layers
- Dense layers
- Output layer

The model is compiled using the Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss function and the Adam optimizer.

## Training
The training process involves the following steps:
1. Data Preprocessing: Scaling the data and splitting it into training and testing sets.
2. Model Building: Constructing the LSTM model using Keras.
3. Model Training: Training the model on the training data with a specified number of epochs and batch size.

## Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using the testing data. Key evaluation metrics include:
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

## Results
The predicted stock prices are compared with the actual prices to visualize the model's performance. Plots are generated to show the predicted vs. actual stock prices.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of LSTM networks in predicting stock prices. The model captures the trend of the stock prices well, although further tuning and additional features could improve its accuracy.
